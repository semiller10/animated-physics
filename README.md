An interesting physics trick that you can perform at home is presented in a 
[Walter Lewin lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjsV9Ccqhi4&list=PLyQSN7X0ro203puVhQsmCj9qhlFQ-As8e&index=10&t=47m19s).

I have modeled this experiment in friction-trick.py and invite you to play around with the parameterization.
